    "# Calibration of photon energy based on diffraction images at multiple distances\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook attempts to determine the X-ray energy by calibrating multiple diffraction images on a calibrant using the pyFAI package. The method is inspired by the work of Caitlin Horn et al.: https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600577519013328. The notebook is based largely on the tutorial on the pyFAI web page: https://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/tutorial/Goniometer/Fit_wavelength/fit_energy.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The X-ray wavelength and sample-to-detector distance (SDD) is correlated and cannot be disentangled by a single calibrant diffraction image. The SDD is difficult to determine by fx. optical means, but the movement of the detector stage is very precise and thus the relative distance between two images is reliable. First, the images are calibrated independently using their nominal SDDs by obtaining control points on the diffraction rings and refining the wavelength for each image. By assuming that the absolute error in SDD is identical for each image, an estimate of the wavelength can be obtained by plotting the refined wavelengths against the reciprocal nominal SDD. A linear fit will have the intersection with the y-axis be the wavelength at infinite SDD, in other words, where the absolute error is insignificant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The procedure is made easier by making a rough SDD estimation in the pyFAI GUI before collecting the images and setting the detector stage to the obtained value by using the `set_user_pos det_z` command. Since the control points on the rings are extracted from a guessed detector geometry, bad results can be obtained for very close SDDs if the guessed geometry is not that precise as the rings are very close together. It is thus recommended to only use images for SDDs larger than 100 mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output energy is used to create a `poni`-file for the integration of sample data based on a calibrant scan in the actual sample position (preferably, the calibrant is placed in the same sample holder as the actual sample). The path for this scan is 'SamPosScan'. The `poni`-file will be saved in the 'process' folder. Alternatively, the energy can be inserted as input directly into the notebook \"Calibration of a single image\" for making a `poni`-file for integration of experimental data. \n",
